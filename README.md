# EvadeLoop
This is a looped version of the first game I ever made. It was also my first experience learning Java as a kid. Built a tinfoil keyboard for it too haha

Update: I think I originally combined it all into one jar with jarsplice or something like that. I want to get it working again someday but I need to play the detective game now.
